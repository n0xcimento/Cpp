Codes created in my C++ language process learning, by Deitel book "C++ How to Program".

In main.cpp there is an example of usage to demonstrate some capabilites of the class; or program when chapter does not involve class.

Also, at each main.c file in each folder, there is its respective proposed problem by the book.
