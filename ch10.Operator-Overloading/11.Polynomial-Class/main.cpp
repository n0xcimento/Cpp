/*

10.11 ( Polynomial Class) Develop class Polynomial . The internal representation of a Polynomial
is an array of terms. Each term contains a coefficient and an exponentâ€”e.g., the term

2x 4

has the coefficient 2 and the exponent 4. Develop a complete class containing proper constructor
and destructor functions as well as set and get functions. The class should also provide the following
overloaded operator capabilities:

a) Overload the addition operator ( + ) to add two Polynomial s.
b) Overload the subtraction operator ( - ) to subtract two Polynomial s.
c) Overload the assignment operator to assign one Polynomial to another.
d) Overload the multiplication operator ( * ) to multiply two Polynomial s.
e) Overload the addition assignment operator ( += ), subtraction assignment operator ( -= ),
and multiplication assignment operator ( *= ).
